# Burn the seal_policies UpgradeCap, making the published package PERMANENTLY IMMUTABLE.
#
# Why: while the cap exists, an upgrade can change `seal_approve*` and so retroactively de-gate (or
# re-gate) every ciphertext sealed under this package. Burning it fixes the policies for good.
#
# This is step 5 of the release lifecycle in CUSTODY.md (publish → transfer to the multisig →
# launch → verify → burn on the planned date). It works for either owner of the cap:
#   - the active address owns the cap   → burns it directly (after a "YES" confirmation);
#   - a multisig owns the cap           → writes the unsigned make_immutable transaction and prints
#                                         the exact steps to sign, combine and execute it.
#
# Usage:
#   NETWORK=testnet bash scripts/make-immutable.sh            # dry run (default): verify and explain
#   NETWORK=testnet DRY_RUN=0 bash scripts/make-immutable.sh  # execute (IRREVERSIBLE) / write the tx
#
# Inputs:
#   NETWORK          target network; the active `sui client` env must equal it (never switched here)
#   UPGRADE_CAP_ID   optional; defaults to Published.toml [published.<network>].upgrade-capability,
#                    then SEAL_POLICIES_UPGRADE_CAP_ID in .env.<network>
#   PACKAGE_ID       optional; defaults to Published.toml [published.<network>].published-at,
#                    then SEAL_POLICIES_PACKAGE_ID in .env.<network>
#   GAS_BUDGET       optional; default 100000000 MIST
#   MAINNET_CONFIRM  must be 1 for mainnet (a skipped mainnet run exits 78)
#   OUT_DIR          multisig path only: where the unsigned transaction is written (default ./custody-out)
